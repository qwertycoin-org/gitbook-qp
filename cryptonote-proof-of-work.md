# CryptoNote Proof of Work

**How to Get Coins \[Mining\]: Default Proof of Work \(CryptoNote V2.0\)**

QWC blockchain project is an open-source project and is driven by community members. Anyone can join and support the network and get coins as compensation to their support through mining.

CryptoNote Technology V2.0 has a built-in block reward system called ‘emission rate’. It is a shape of log function and, because of its original design, **QWC block rewards will reduce by each block found and eventually reach a point called ‘tail emission’.**

QWC has an emission factor of 19. Please refer to below graphs to see how block rewards are reduced over time.
