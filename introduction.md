# Introduction

**Introduction**

Qwertycoin \(Ticker: QWC\) is an open source project for creating a decentralized digital asset, like Bitcoin.

It is based on CryptoNote Technology V2.0. Nobody owns or controls Qwertycoin except its users. It allows anonymous and trustless peer to peer transactions through a fair PoW mining algorithm and will implement EPoSe, a new consensus algorithm concept exclusive to QWC.

Qwertycoin transactions are safe, reliable, untraceable, unlinkable and your privacy is protected. Mathematics secures the QWC network and empowers individuals to control their own finance and information.
