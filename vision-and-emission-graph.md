Qwertycoin \(QWC\) team envisions the future of finance relies on distributed ledger technology, the blockchain. Unlike traceable bitcoin, QWC developers applied CryptoNote Technology V2.0, which has been verified to provide anonymity of users from the earlier generations of cryptocurrencies.

Everyone is free to join all QWC network and use its services at a low cost. However, QWC requires a central authority for the development and the management of QWC network and blockchain. Community engagements and donations are necessary to keep the development moving forward.

QWC team operates under the unanimous consensus of transparent management for all its members.
