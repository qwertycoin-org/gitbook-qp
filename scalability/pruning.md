# Pruning

Pruning allows nodes to stay light in terms of storage space, improving scalability of the blockchain.

This is not a permanent solution, but it does help general nodes to shave off space and improve the node's sustainability in the network without increasing the processor speed or storage space.

The original implementation took place in bitcoin repository and it has propagated to other core development projects.
