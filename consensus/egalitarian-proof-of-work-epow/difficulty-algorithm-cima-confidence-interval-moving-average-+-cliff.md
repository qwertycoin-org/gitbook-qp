# Difficulty Algorithm - CIMA \(Confidence Interval Moving Average\)

CIMA stands for Confidence Interval Moving Average. This Difficulty Algorithm\('DA', hereinafter\) takes the basic form of moving average techniques in statistics. Normally 95%-98% confidence interval is chosen for statistical analysis. 

What this stands for is that 98% of the values are normally distributed within the confidence interval from a mean value of the sample population. The percentage value does not necessarily represent that the future samples are likely to be within that specific interval range.
