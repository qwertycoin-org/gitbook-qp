# Testnet Result

CLIF dropped difficulty over time until miners are able to find a block within the 120-second interval.

CLIF does not drop algorithm instantly but gradually over time. The X-axis represents each block height, so it does not show how long it took to find the block after CLIF is triggered.

After CLIF has adjusted difficulty, the miners were able to find blocks after a short downtime and no interference from the core team to offset the chain-stagnation from the 800X attack.
