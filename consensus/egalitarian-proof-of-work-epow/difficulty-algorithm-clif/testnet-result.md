# Testnet Result

CLIF dropped difficulty over time until miners are able to find a block within the 120-second interval.

The X-axis represents each block height, so it does not show how long it took to find the block after CLIF is triggered.

After CLIF adjusted difficulty, the miners were able to find blocks after a short downtime.There was no interference from the core team to offset the stagnation from the 800X attack.
