# About switching mining algorithm

I see CN projects that copy the names of QWC's main ideas without really knowing what they need to do or how to do it.

**\[The first example - EPoW\]**

There is a CN project that sells this idea to its investors. Not going to name it. 

Changing the mining algorithm from ASIC friendly to CPU bound does not make it egalitarian. Penalizing network participants based on their equipment is nonsense. Look up what egalitarian means first.

Let me throw an example. 

What if we changed to some popular CPU algorithm and someone figured out how to beat it with a counter algorithm that only he knows. Now he makes tons of profits without letting others know.

How is this algorithm he owns different from ASIC miners? They are all the same. At least, ASICs are available in the market for everyone to purchase if have enough capital.

Do not fall for this type of propaganda. Want to be energy efficient? Then, just switch to PoS project.

Claiming to be the first is not important if you don't know how to build it right.

**\[The second example - \(Egalitarian\)Proof of Service based on uptime\]**
