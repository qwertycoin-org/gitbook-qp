# Testnet Result

The core team has tested CIMA and its performance up to 800X attack case scenario.

![Difficulty graph when 800X hashrate increase](../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The summary of this attack is as follow  
  
1. QWC is designed to produce 720 blocks within 24 hour period. This is equivalent to 30 blocks per hour.   
  
2. The attack lasted for 16 hours in time and the attacker found 560 blocks. That is equivalent to 35 blocks per hour. CIMA DA reached a proper range of difficulty level after 400 blocks. \(We know this because it is a controlled environment.\)  
  
3. If we tested for 24 hours, the number of blocks per hour found by the attacker would be close to 30 blocks per hour. Because the algorithm constantly adjusts to a new mean value within a range of previous blocks.   
  
So what about the number of coins the chain produced?  
  
4. At the block height where the test was conducted, the average block reward was 347,500 per block. If attack succeeded, the miner would have received 194.6 million coins.  
  
5. With CIMA+Consistency, the algorithm reduced the emission to 124.4 million coins.  
  
6. If there were no attacks, the network would have released 166.8 million coins.  
  
So, let's assume that you have the massive mining power and reading this part of whitepaper wanting to mine QWC. What is your choice? Attack or Join?
