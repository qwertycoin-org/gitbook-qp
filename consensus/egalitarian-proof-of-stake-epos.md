# Egalitarian Proof of Stake \(EPoS\) - Hybrid PoS/dPoS

The core team will update this section as more ideas become solid towards establishing EPoS. One thing that is sure at this point is that EPoS will be a hybrid form of Proof of Stake\(PoS\) / delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\).

I find a lot of similarities between PoW and PoS in terms of their ecosystems.

For example, If you look at how our or most PoW consensus ecosystem is formed, it has two distinct groups. One is a set of miners and the other is a set of pools. 

Miners can choose how to mine depending on their hash rates.  
  
Group A\) If a miner with a good amount of hash rates, solo mining is the best.   
Group B\) Miners with smaller hash rates have a better chance of finding a block when they pull their hash rates together to find blocks.

Structure-wise, Group A is similar to PoS, and Group B is similar to dPoS.  

PoS implementation will have similar staking and reward system of other PoS coins.

dPoS implementation will allow pool staking for those that have not enough coins to run a solo staking node. This gives the minorities a chance to have a representative for their share just like how we elect officers to delegate. 

**`For those developers and idea suppliers to other cryptos.. stop copying without giving a proper credit. I see already two CN coins or maybe 3 cheating all the time. Shame on those copies. Implementations are poor and they did not think through. The end realization is incomplete and they jump on to something else to create just hypes. No real work there. Just using names and terms does not make them right. Funny, right?`**

More updates coming soon....
