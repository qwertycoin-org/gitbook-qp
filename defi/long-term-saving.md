# Long Term Staking \(LTS\)

Long Term Staking \(LTS\) is structure-wise identical to Time Locked Transaction \(TLT\).

LTS transaction amount is reinstated to the original sender's wallet after a designated time or block height.

This feature does not yield an interest. It only serves the purpose of minimum deposit for EPoS staking.
