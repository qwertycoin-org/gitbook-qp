# Community Voting

Currently, QWC uses an online voting system [here](https://voting.qwertycoin.org).

The notion behind our voting system is not about equal right for everyone. It is about how much members are willing to spend on decisions they want to influence. So yes, you will have to spend your coins to voice your opinion and there is no minimum nor maximum number of coins one can vote.

This type of voting is more democratic because the power that can influence decisions does not stay within one person or group over time. Everyone has to earn the rights.

QWC team \(a centralized body that consists of a group of people who volunteer to provide services\) reflects the decisions of QWC community through a community voting system. All QWC members can participate in making community-wide decisions.
