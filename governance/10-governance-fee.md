Please check the voting result. The implementation of this 10% government fee will be from the block rewards. All gov't fees will be used for project developments.

The use of this taxed fund will be reported and monitored transparently through the wallet view key.

The implementation of this fee collection starts from block version 6, equivalent to QWC's block height 700,000.
